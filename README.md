Certainly! Here's a Python homework assignment based on the requirements you mentioned:

**Python Homework: Visualizing Progress in a Scene**

In this homework, you will write a Python program that utilizes matplotlib to build a scene divided into an 8x8 grid of blocks. You will randomly select one block and count from 0 to 100 within a specified time period and show its progress with progressbar beside of scene. Additionally, if two progress bars exist simultaneously, they should be displayed together in random locations beside the scene.

Your output should include the following:

- The initial scene displayed as a grayscale image.
- MainWindow must have `pause` and `resume` button.
- The scene with progress bar(s) displayed at random locations beside it.

Remember to comment your code, provide clear explanations for each step, and follow Python coding conventions.

Good luck with your homework!
